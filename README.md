# Quantum-Initialization experiments
The source code in this repository was developed and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Scientific Linux 7.9
using PyTorch 1.7.1 . 

To evaluate quantum random numbers and pseudorandom numbers for CNN initialization on MNIST run ```./scripts/run_cnn_exps.sh```

Similarly for the rnn case run ```./scripts/run_rnn_exps.sh```
