# Quantum-Initialization experiments
This repository contains source code to compare quantum and pseudorandom initialization of 
convolutional and recurrent neural networks.

To evaluate quantum random numbers, pseudorandom, and pseudo-quantum numbers for CNN initialization on MNIST run ```./scripts/run_cnn_exps.sh```.

Similarly for the rnn case run ```./scripts/run_rnn_exps.sh``` .

The source code in this repository was developed and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Scientific Linux 7.9
using PyTorch 1.7.1 .
